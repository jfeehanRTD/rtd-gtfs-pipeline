# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

RTD GTFS-RT Data Pipeline - A Java application using Apache Flink to download and process real-time transit feeds from RTD Denver.

## Build and Run Commands

### Prerequisites
- Java 24
- Maven 3.6+
- Apache Flink 2.1.0 (for cluster deployment)
- Apache Kafka 4.0.0 (for data output)

### Build Commands
```bash
# Clean and compile
mvn clean compile

# Run tests
mvn test

# Package application
mvn clean package

# Package without tests (faster)
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

### Run Commands

#### Local Development (Flink Mini Cluster)
```bash
# Run with Maven (includes all dependencies)
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.rtd.pipeline.RTDGTFSPipeline"

# Run packaged JAR
java -cp target/rtd-gtfs-pipeline-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.rtd.pipeline.RTDGTFSPipeline
```

#### Flink Cluster Deployment
```bash
# Submit to Flink cluster
flink run target/rtd-gtfs-pipeline-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Components
- **RTDGTFSPipeline**: Main job class that orchestrates the entire pipeline
- **GTFSRealtimeSource**: Custom source function that downloads GTFS-RT feeds every hour
- **Data Models**: VehiclePosition, TripUpdate, Alert - representing the three GTFS-RT feed types
- **Table API Sinks**: Print connectors for processed data output

### Data Flow
1. **Source**: HTTP requests to RTD GTFS-RT endpoints every hour
2. **Parse**: Protobuf deserialization of GTFS-RT feeds
3. **Transform**: Conversion to structured data models
4. **Sink**: Table API output (currently print connector, easily configurable for databases)

### Feed URLs
- Vehicle Positions: `https://www.rtd-denver.com/google_sync/VehiclePosition.pb`
- Trip Updates: `https://www.rtd-denver.com/google_sync/TripUpdate.pb`
- Alerts: `https://www.rtd-denver.com/google_sync/Alert.pb`

## Development Guidelines

- Always run tests after making code changes to ensure functionality remains intact
- The pipeline processes three separate GTFS-RT feed types in parallel streams
- Each feed is fetched hourly and parsed using the Google GTFS-RT protobuf library
- Watermarks are configured for 1-minute out-of-order tolerance
- Table API sinks can be easily reconfigured for different output formats (Kafka, databases, etc.)
