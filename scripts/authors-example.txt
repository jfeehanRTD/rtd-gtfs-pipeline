# SVN to Git Authors Mapping
# Format: svn-username = Git Name <email@domain.com>
# 
# This file maps SVN usernames to proper Git author identities.
# Edit this file with correct names and email addresses before migration.

# Example mappings - replace with your actual SVN users

jsmith = Jane Smith <jane.smith@rtd-denver.com>
admin = System Admin <admin@rtd-denver.com>
developer = Developer Account <developer@rtd-denver.com>
builduser = Build System <build@rtd-denver.com>

# Common system accounts
jenkins = Jenkins CI <jenkins@rtd-denver.com>
bamboo = Bamboo Build <bamboo@rtd-denver.com>
teamcity = TeamCity <teamcity@rtd-denver.com>

# Legacy accounts
legacy = Legacy User <legacy@rtd-denver.com>
unknown = Unknown User <unknown@rtd-denver.com>
