## Testing Commands

```bash
# Check all services status
./check-all-services.sh

# Test feed endpoints
./test-feeds.sh

# View logs
tail -f rtd-pipeline.log      # Main pipeline
tail -f react-app.log          # React app
```

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start all services
./rtd-control.sh start all

# Start feed receivers (after building)
source .env
java -cp target/rtd-gtfs-pipeline-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.rtd.pipeline.RailCommHTTPReceiver &
java -cp target/rtd-gtfs-pipeline-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.rtd.pipeline.BusCommHTTPReceiver &
```

## Summary

All feed errors have been resolved. Both Rail Communication and Bus SIRI feeds are:
