**Features**:
- **Search**: Filter by vehicle ID, route, or trip
- **Type Filtering**: Separate buses and trains
- **Real-time Filter**: Show only vehicles with current data
- **Sorting Options**: By ID, route, time, or speed
- **Group View**: Vehicles organized by route with expand/collapse
- **Batch Selection**: Select all or clear all vehicles
- **Status Indicators**: Vehicle status, occupancy, and delay information

**UI Elements**:
- Expandable route groups showing vehicle counts
- Individual vehicle cards with status indicators
- Speed, occupancy, and delay metrics
- Last update timestamps
- Selection checkboxes with visual feedback

### 3. Data Source Management Panel

**File**: `src/components/DataSourcePanel.tsx`

**Description**: Real-time monitoring and management of available data sources.

**Features**:
- **Connection Status**: Live monitoring of each data source
- **Latency Metrics**: Response time tracking
- **Vehicle Counts**: Number of vehicles from each source
- **Capability Indicators**: What each source supports (streaming, historical, etc.)
- **Configuration**: Expandable details for each source
- **Source Selection**: Choose which sources to query

**Data Sources Monitored**:
- Kafka Vehicle Positions Topic
- Kafka Trip Updates Topic  
- Flink Aggregated Data
- RTD Direct GTFS-RT API
- PostgreSQL Historical Database
- WebSocket Live Stream

### 4. Real-Time Vehicle Tracker

**File**: `src/components/VehicleTracker.tsx`

**Description**: Advanced real-time tracking system with playback controls and analytics.

**Features**:
- **Play/Pause Controls**: Start and stop real-time tracking
- **Refresh Intervals**: Configurable update frequency (1-60 seconds)
- **High-Frequency Mode**: 1-second updates for critical monitoring
- **Vehicle History**: Track paths and position changes over time
- **Live Statistics**: Updates, average speed, distance traveled
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time push notifications for vehicle updates

**Analytics Provided**:
- Total update count
- Average vehicle speeds
- Estimated distance traveled
- Number of active vehicles being tracked
- Last update timestamps

### 5. Enhanced Map Integration

**Updates to**: `src/App.tsx`

**Description**: The main application now integrates all new tools with a professional toolbar interface.

**New UI Elements**:
- **Tool Buttons**: Quick access to Data Sources, Vehicle Selector, and Tracker
- **Selection Counter**: Shows how many vehicles are selected for tracking
- **Multi-Panel Layout**: Side panels that can be shown/hidden independently
- **Status Integration**: Real-time connection status in header

**User Workflow**:
1. Open Data Sources panel to see available feeds
2. Use Vehicle Selector to choose specific vehicles to track  
3. Start Vehicle Tracker for real-time monitoring
4. View individual vehicle details by clicking on map markers

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Service Layer**: DataQueryService manages all external data connections
- **Component Layer**: Modular UI components for each feature
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state, shared via props
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with proper interfaces

### Data Flow
1. **Data Sources**: Multiple concurrent connections to various feeds
2. **Query Service**: Centralizes data fetching and connection management
3. **Vehicle Selector**: Allows user to choose specific vehicles
4. **Tracker**: Manages real-time updates and history for selected vehicles
5. **Map Display**: Shows real-time positions and allows interaction

### Key Interfaces

```typescript
// Data source configuration
interface DataSource {
  id: string;
  name: string;  
  type: 'kafka' | 'flink' | 'database' | 'api' | 'websocket';
  endpoint: string;
  status: 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'error';
  capabilities: string[];
}

// Query options for flexible data retrieval
interface QueryOptions {
  sources: string[];
  vehicleIds?: string[];
  routeIds?: string[];
  boundingBox?: BoundingBox;
  timeRange?: TimeRange;
  realTimeOnly?: boolean;
}

// Vehicle history tracking
interface VehicleHistory {
  vehicleId: string;
  positions: Array<{
    timestamp: Date;
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    speed?: number;
    bearing?: number;
    status?: string;
  }>;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Query Multiple Data Sources
```typescript
const vehicles = await queryService.queryVehicles({
  sources: ['kafka-vehicles', 'rtd-direct', 'flink-aggregated'],
  routeIds: ['A', 'B', 'C'],
  boundingBox: denverMetroArea,
  realTimeOnly: true
});
```

### Subscribe to Real-Time Updates
```typescript
const unsubscribe = queryService.subscribeToVehicle(
  'RTD_1234',
  (vehicle) => console.log('Vehicle update:', vehicle)
);
```

### Track Vehicle History
```typescript
const history = await queryService.getVehicleHistory('RTD_1234', {
  start: new Date(Date.now() - 3600000), // Last hour
  end: new Date()
});
```

## Performance Features

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses connections across components
- **Automatic Failover**: Falls back to alternative data sources
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching of recent queries
- **Batching**: Groups requests to reduce API load
- **WebSocket Optimization**: Uses persistent connections for real-time data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Route Analysis**: Historical route performance analytics
2. **Predictive Modeling**: AI-powered arrival time predictions  
3. **Alert System**: Custom notifications for delays or service disruptions
4. **Export Tools**: Data export to CSV, JSON, or PDF reports
5. **Fleet Management**: Advanced tools for transit operators
6. **Mobile Support**: Responsive design optimizations

## Development Server

The application is now running on `http://localhost:3002` with all enhanced features available for testing and development.

## Build Status

✅ All components build successfully
✅ TypeScript compilation passes
✅ No runtime errors
✅ Development server running

## Summary

This enhancement transforms the RTD Maps App from a basic transit map into a professional-grade transit monitoring and analysis platform. The new tools provide comprehensive visibility into RTD's fleet operations while maintaining the intuitive interface users expect.
