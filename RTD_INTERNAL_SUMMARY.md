# RTD Internal GTFS Pipeline - Summary

## 🎯 What This Project Does

**You work at RTD. This pipeline GENERATES the public GTFS feed that Google Maps and other apps consume.**

This is not a consumer of GTFS - it's the **producer** of RTD's public transit data.

---

## 📊 Your Data Sources

### Primary: MTRAM System
- RTD's internal scheduling/runboard system
- Contains: Trips, schedules, runboards, service periods
- Access via: REST API (see MTRAM-ETL project)

### Secondary: Oracle TIES (if needed)
- Legacy database with routes, stops, shapes, fares
- Access via: PL/SQL functions (now replaced with Java)
- Goal: Minimize or eliminate Oracle dependency

## 💰 Why Replace Oracle PL/SQL?

### Current State (Oracle TIES)
- **Cost:** $47,500/year (Oracle license)
- **Cost:** $10,450/year (Support)
- **Cost:** $60,000/year (DBA 50% FTE)
- **Cost:** $24,000/year (DB Server)
- **Total:** $141,950/year

### New State (Java + MTRAM)
- **Cost:** $6,000/year (App server)
- **Savings:** $135,950/year (96% reduction)

Plus:
- ✅ Cloud-native (Kubernetes/AKS ready)
- ✅ 50-180x faster data processing
- ✅ Easier to maintain and scale
- ✅ Modern development stack

## 🚀 Three Approaches for RTD

### Approach 1: MTRAM Only (Best if MTRAM has all data) ⭐

```java
// Connect to MTRAM API
MTRAMDataConnector mtram = new MTRAMDataConnector(mtramApiUrl);

// Fetch scheduling data
List<RunboardOverview> runboards = mtram.getActiveRunboards();
List<GTFSCalendar> calendars = mtram.convertRunboardsToCalendar(runboards);
List<GTFSTrip> trips = mtram.convertToGTFSTrips(runboards);
List<GTFSStopTime> stopTimes = mtram.convertToGTFSStopTimes(runboards);

// Get static data (routes, stops) - if MTRAM has it, use it
List<GTFSRoute> routes = mtram.getRoutes();
List<GTFSStop> stops = mtram.getStops();

// Generate GTFS
generateGTFSZip(calendars, trips, stopTimes, routes, stops);
```

**When to use:** MTRAM API provides all needed GTFS data

**Benefits:**
- Zero Oracle dependency
- Single source of truth
- Real-time updates
- Maximum cost savings

---

### Approach 2: MTRAM + Oracle TIES (Hybrid)

```java
// Get schedule data from MTRAM
MTRAMDataConnector mtram = new MTRAMDataConnector(mtramApiUrl);
List<GTFSTrip> trips = mtram.getTrips();
List<GTFSStopTime> stopTimes = mtram.getStopTimes();
List<GTFSCalendar> calendars = mtram.getCalendar();

// Get static data from Oracle TIES (only if not in MTRAM)
TIESDataExtractor ties = new TIESDataExtractor(oracleConnection);
List<GTFSRoute> routes = ties.extractRoutes();
List<GTFSStop> stops = ties.extractStops();
List<GTFSShape> shapes = ties.extractShapes();
List<GTFSFareProduct> fares = ties.extractFareProducts();

// Combine and generate GTFS
generateGTFSZip(trips, stopTimes, calendars, routes, stops, shapes, fares);
```

**When to use:** MTRAM missing critical static data (routes, stops, shapes)

**Benefits:**
- Uses MTRAM for what it's good at (scheduling)
- Falls back to TIES for static data
- Gradual migration path

---

### Approach 3: Static Files + MTRAM (Recommended for Production)

```java
// Static data (routes, stops, shapes) - changes rarely, store in files
GTFSStaticData staticData = loadFromFiles("/gtfs/static");

// Dynamic data from MTRAM - changes daily
MTRAMDataConnector mtram = new MTRAMDataConnector(mtramApiUrl);
List<GTFSTrip> trips = mtram.getTrips();
List<GTFSStopTime> stopTimes = mtram.getStopTimes();
List<GTFSCalendar> calendars = mtram.getCalendar();

// Combine
generateGTFSZip(staticData, trips, stopTimes, calendars);
```

**When to use:** Production deployment with stable routes/stops

**Benefits:**
- Zero database queries for static data
- MTRAM only for schedule updates
- Fastest performance
- Complete Oracle elimination

## 🎯 What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Understand Your MTRAM API

```bash
# Look at your MTRAM backend API documentation
# What endpoints does it expose?
# What data does it provide?

# Test endpoints:
curl http://mtram-api/api/runboards/overview
curl http://mtram-api/api/trips
curl http://mtram-api/api/schedules
```

### Step 2: Map MTRAM Data to GTFS

Create a mapping document:
```
MTRAM Runboard → GTFS calendar.txt
MTRAM Trip → GTFS trips.txt
MTRAM Schedule → GTFS stop_times.txt
etc.
```

### Step 3: Decide What Comes from Oracle (if anything)

```
Does MTRAM have:
- Routes? If yes, use MTRAM. If no, extract from Oracle TIES
- Stops? If yes, use MTRAM. If no, extract from Oracle TIES
- Shapes? Probably not - use Oracle TIES or static files
- Fares? Probably not - use Oracle TIES or static files
```

### Step 4: Implement MTRAMDataConnector

```java
// Fill in the TODOs in MTRAMDataConnector.java based on your actual API

// Current placeholders to implement:
public List<GTFSTrip> convertToGTFSTrips(RunboardDetails details) {
    // TODO: Map your MTRAM data structure to GTFS trips
}

public List<GTFSStopTime> convertToGTFSStopTimes(RunboardDetails details) {
    // TODO: Map your MTRAM schedule to GTFS stop_times
}
```

### Step 5: Test with Real Data

```bash
# Build
mvn clean package

# Test MTRAM connection
java -cp target/*.jar com.rtd.pipeline.mtram.MTRAMDataConnector

# Test full pipeline
java -cp target/*.jar com.rtd.pipeline.RTDGTFSGenerator
```

### Step 6: Deploy

```bash
# Option A: Run on schedule (cron/Task Scheduler)
# Daily at midnight: generate fresh GTFS

# Option B: Kubernetes deployment
kubectl apply -f k8s/gtfs-generator.yaml

# Option C: Azure Function (event-driven)
# Trigger on MTRAM runboard promotion events
```

---

## 🔄 Typical Daily Workflow

```
1. Midnight: Scheduled job starts

2. Fetch from MTRAM:
   - Active runboards
   - Trip schedules
   - Service calendar
   - Holidays/exceptions

3. Get static data:
   Option A: From cached files (fastest)
   Option B: From MTRAM API (if available)
   Option C: From Oracle TIES (fallback)

4. Convert to GTFS:
   - Create calendar.txt from runboards
   - Create trips.txt from schedules
   - Create stop_times.txt from schedules
   - Combine with routes.txt, stops.txt, etc.

5. Validate:
   - Run GTFS validator
   - Check for errors

6. Publish:
   - Create google_transit.zip
   - Upload to rtd-denver.com/api/download
   - Notify consumers (optional)

7. Archive:
   - Keep historical versions
   - Log generation metrics
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these to measure success:

### Technical
- ✅ GTFS generation time (< 5 minutes)
- ✅ File size (reasonable for download)
- ✅ Validation errors (zero)
- ✅ API response time (< 200ms)

### Business
- ✅ Oracle license eliminated ($47,500/year saved)
- ✅ DBA hours reduced (50% → 0%)
- ✅ Public feed always current (< 24 hours old)
- ✅ Google Maps shows correct schedules

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Don't Use Public Feed
You mentioned: "I don't want to use the public feed because I work at RTD"

**Correct!** You are CREATING the public feed, not consuming it.

The `GTFSDataProcessor` has a mode to download from the public URL, but that's for external consumers. You should:
1. Use `MTRAMDataConnector` to get data from MTRAM
2. Use `TIESDataExtractor` only if needed for missing data
3. Generate your own GTFS files
4. Publish those as the public feed

### Oracle TIES - Use Only if Needed
The `TIESDataExtractor` is available as a fallback, but minimize Oracle usage:
- Try to get everything from MTRAM first
- Use static files for rarely-changing data (routes, stops, shapes)
- Only query TIES for data truly not available elsewhere

### MTRAM API - Document It!
Create a wiki/doc page with:
- All available endpoints
- Request/response formats
- Authentication method
- Rate limits (if any)
- Update frequency

## 📞 Questions to Answer

Before full implementation:

1. **MTRAM API Access**
   - What's the API base URL?
   - How do you authenticate?
   - What's the rate limit?

2. **Data Availability**
   - Does MTRAM have routes/stops or just schedules?
   - Are fares in MTRAM or only in TIES?
   - Where are shapes stored?

3. **Update Frequency**
   - How often do runboards change?
   - Daily GTFS generation sufficient?
   - Need real-time updates?

4. **Existing Process**
   - How is GTFS currently generated?
   - Any manual steps to eliminate?
   - Integration points with other systems?
